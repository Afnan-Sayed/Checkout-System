- Support for **expirable products** (e.g., Cheese, Biscuits) with expiry date.
- Support for **shippable** and **non-shippable** products.
- Add products to cart in specific quantities (must not exceed available stock).

## Assumptions 
I noticed in the output console example that the shipping cost was 30 when the weight was nearly 1 kg (1.1kg â†’ 30 EGP shipping), so I assumed the shipping cost is 30 EGP per kg.
